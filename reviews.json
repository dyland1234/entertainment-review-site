The announcement, made via Gunn's social media account was accompanied by a stunning concept artwork that has already sparked fervent speculation about the plot and dynamics of the upcoming movie. While the plot details remain under wraps, the artwork and Gunn's previous comments suggest a complex narrative. In the first film, Luthor's hatred for superman culminated in his disgrace and imprisonment at Belle Reve. However, the sequel may see luthor paroled to assist in a classified government project.. Man of Tomorrow is part of a broader DCU slate, following Supergirl (June 2026) and Clayface (September 2026). Gunn has reffered his Superman films as the Superman Saga, indicating a multi-part narrativve that will extend beyond this sequel. The integration of characters like Supergirl and the JUstice Society suggests a connected universe building toward larger storylines",

    "content": "A triumph return to form. This is the Superman we've been waiting for: soaring, hopeful epic that remind us why he's the world's greates superhero. Superman became another block buster hit for DC Studios following the success of Creature Commandoes months prior. The movie was not only good but it exceeded the expectation of it's last incarnation, Man of Steel which was a controversial movie and the launch of a failed universe that is the DCEU. James Gunn not only understood superman he understood the core concept of what it's means to be kind which is superman's number one trait, he also brought superman back to the bright and hopeful dork we all know and love contrast to the dark and gritty vibe of Zack Snyder. So we, the folks at ER give Superman 4/5 stars  ",
    "pros": ["It displays the Core character of superman", "Bright and hopeful", "Kindness is the new punk rock"],
    "cons": ["Too much comedy"]
