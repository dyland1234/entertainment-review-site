    "content": "Michael Jackson didn’t just top charts—he engineered a blueprint for pop stardom that still runs today. From sonic experimentation on “Thriller” to genre-bending visuals and choreography, MJ fused sound, spectacle, and storytelling into a single, global language.\n\nHis influence is audible in modern pop, R&B, and even K-pop staging. The critique is that his personal controversies overshadow the art; the counterpoint is that the artistic legacy remains singular.",

    "content": "A triumph return to form. This is the Superman we've been waiting for: soaring, hopeful epic that remind us why he's the world's greates superhero. Superman became another block buster hit for DC Studios following the success of Creature Commandoes months prior. The movie was not only good but it exceeded the expectation of it's last incarnation, Man of Steel which was a controversial movie and the launch of a failed universe that is the DCEU. James Gunn not only understood superman he understood the core concept of what it's means to be kind which is superman's number one trait, he also brought superman back to the bright and hopeful dork we all know and love contrast to the dark and gritty vibe of Zack Snyder. So we, the folks at ER give Superman 4/5 stars  ",
    "pros": ["It displays the Core character of superman", "Bright and hopeful", "Kindness is the new punk rock"],
    "cons": ["Too much comedy"]
